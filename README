This is the complete libft project with bonus from 42 from Malaga.

I has passed paco -s with total success.

I have also made a main.c so the function can be tested by a human or similar.

To compile

1st: make
2nd: gcc -o main.out main.c libft.a
3rd: ?
4th: PROFIT

DO NOT COPY (or do it, I'm a readme file, not a staff member and the coder is many thing but cop isn't one).
Use it for inspiration so you will learn.

Also you may write me to:

Any feedback would be appreciated.
